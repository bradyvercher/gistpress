# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* Temporarily suspend PHP Warnings on invalid tags when processing Gist HTML ([#81](https://github.com/bradyvercher/gistpress/issues/81))

## [v3.0.2] - 2020-01-16

* Sanitized the `id` attribute passed to the `[gist]` shortcode. This fixes an XSS vulnerability that could be exploited by untrusted contributors on multi-author sites. Thanks to [@cornerpirate](https://github.com/cornerpirate) for disclosing responsibly.
* Added an XML encoding declaration to load Gist content as UTF-8 ([#76](https://github.com/bradyvercher/gistpress/issues/76)).
* Removed `DOCTYPE`, `html` and `body` elements added by DOMDocument.
* Ensured the $gistpress global exists and is an instance of `GistPress` before running ([#72](https://github.com/bradyvercher/gistpress/issues/72)). Props [@robneu](https://github.com/robneu)

## [v3.0.0] - 2015-08-11

## [v1.1.0] - 2013-01-03

* Rework after Gist refresh. New caching implementation and features.
* Comments and formatting tweaks.
* Removed the ability to wrap URLs in `[gist]` shortcodes in order to allow self-closing shortcodes without a closing slash. Either a URL for simple oEmbed-like functionality or a shortcode with the required 'id' attribute should be used.

* Converted to a singleton instead of static methods.

* Refactor main plugin file.
* Code standards improvements.

* Refactor creation of transient key name.
* Allow raw transients to be deleted on post save so changes to the Gist can be fetched.
* Fixed issue with raw HTML not getting processed if it came from the transient.
* Updated priority for the style sheet registration hook.

* Improved consistency of file-level documentation.
* Added a `lines_start` attribute to specify an arbitrary line number to start counting from.

* Added `README.md`.
